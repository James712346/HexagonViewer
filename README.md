# Vite React TypeScript SQL.js Tailwind Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate that utilizes Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and SQL.js (SQLite).

## Overview

This boilerplate serves as a starting point for building web applications that require a client-side, in-browser database powered by SQL.js.

- **Vite**: A fast, versatile build tool for web development that provides instant server start and optimized production builds.

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling you to create interactive and responsive web applications.

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.

- **SQL.js**: A JavaScript library that uses emscripten to compile SQLite to webassembly

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling your web application a breeze, allowing you to build beautiful and responsive user interfaces with ease.

### Live Demo

Here is a live demo that uses the SQLite database file of [Chinook database](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) as an example. The Chinook is a sample database that provides a set of tables and data, making it a great starting point to experiment with SQL.js features and functionalities.

You can access the live demo at [Demo Link](https://iliareshetov.github.io/react-sqlite-boilerplate/).
